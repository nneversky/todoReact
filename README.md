A simple yet functional Todo application built with React and date-fns for time formatting.

Key Features:
✅ Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete
✅ Filter tasks (All, Active, Completed)
✅ Real-time task duration (updates every 10s)
✅ Edit tasks (toggle editing mode)
✅ Clear completed tasks
✅ Responsive & clean UI

Tech Stack:
⚛️ React (Class Components)
📅 date-fns (for time formatting)
🔄 setInterval (auto-updating task timers)
🎨 CSS (no external UI libraries)

How It Works:
Tasks persist in component state (no backend).

Auto-refreshing timers show how long ago a task was created.

Filters dynamically update the task list.
