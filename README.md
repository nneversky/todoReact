Tech Stack:
⚛️ React (Class Components)
📅 date-fns (for time formatting)
🔄 setInterval (auto-updating task timers)
🎨 CSS (no external UI libraries)

How It Works:
Tasks persist in component state (no backend).

Auto-refreshing timers show how long ago a task was created.

Filters dynamically update the task list.
